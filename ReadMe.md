# Sort and search algorithms

---

This repository has some common search / sort algorithms written in python, I also included the pseudocode of each algorithm alongside the actual code.

**Algorithms**:

* Search Algorithms
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search
  * Step Search
* Sort Algorithms
  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort

#### Notes

New algorithms will most likely not be added, the only things I may add in the near future are the advantages / disadvantages of each algorithm.
